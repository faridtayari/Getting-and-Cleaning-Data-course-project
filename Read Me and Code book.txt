Data is downloaded and unzipped in the “UCI HAR Dataset” folder. 
I used subject_train, X_train, y_train, from train folder and subject_test, X_test, y_test from test folder.
I also used features.txt and activity_labels.txt files from the main directory.

First part:   
For making a train data set, I cbind subject_train, y_train, and X_train. I do similar for test. Then merged two train and test data sets by subject using the join function: train_test_merged<-join(subyxtrain,subyxtest)
I redo the first part in the second section using a more efficient technique and removing the problem with duplicated columns. 
Second part: 
In this part I answered the question 1, 2 and 4
I read the descriptive variable names from features.txt and store them as character vector. Then I changed the names of X_train into descriptive names (xtrain2). I did the similar for X_test. Then I cbind subject_train, y_train, and X_train and made a new data set for train with descriptive names (subyxtrain2). I also did the same thing for test (subyxtest2). Then I merged the two data sets and got a new comprehensive data set (train_test_merged2).
Then I used grep() function to select the variables that have “mean” or “std” in their names.

Third  part:
I used revalue() function to replace the factored activities by their descriptive names.

Fourth part:
Explained and done in part 2:

Fifth part:
In this section I separated the variable based on activity and subject and took average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
